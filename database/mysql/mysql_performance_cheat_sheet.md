## System Variables

MySQL has lots of variables that you can consider to change. Some variables are dynamic which means they can be set using the SET statement. Others require a server restart, after they are set in the configuration file (e.g. /etc/my.cnf, etc/mysql/my.cnf). However, I’ll go over the common things that are pretty common to tune to make the server optimized.

### sort_buffer_size
This variable controls how large your filesort buffer is, which means that whenever a query needs to sort the rows, the value of this variable is used to limit the size that needs to be allocated. Take note that `this variable is per-query that is processed (or per-connection) basis`, which means that it would be a memory hungry when you set this higher and if you have multiple connections that requires sorting of your rows. 

However, you can monitor your needs by checking the global status variable Sort_merge_passes. If this value is large, you should consider increasing the value of the sort_buffer_size system variable. Otherwise, take it to the moderate limit that you need. If you set this too low or if you have large queries to process, the effect of sorting your rows can be slower than expected because data is retrieved randomly doing disk dives. This can cause performance degradation. However, it is best to fix your queries. Otherwise, if your application is designed to pull large queries and requires sorting, then it is efficient to use tools that handles query caching like Redis. By default, in MySQL 8.0, the current value set is 256 KiB. Set this accordingly only when you have queries that are heavily using or calling sorts.

### read_buffer_size
MySQL documentation mentions that for each request that performs a sequential scan of a table, it allocates a read buffer. The read_buffer_size system variable determines the buffer size. It is also useful for MyISAM, but this variable affects all storage engines as well. For MEMORY tables, it is use to determine the memory block size.

Basically, each thread that does a sequential scan for a MyISAM table allocates a buffer of this size (in bytes) for each table it scans. It does applies for all storage engines (that includes InnoDB) as well, so it’s helpful for queries that are sorting rows using ORDER BY and caching its indexes in a temporary file. If you do many sequential scans, bulk insert into partition tables, caching results of nested queries, then consider increasing its value. The value of this variable should be a multiple of 4KB. If it is set to a value that is not a multiple of 4KB, its value will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of 4KB. Take into account that setting this to a higher value will consume a large chunk of your server’s memory. I suggest not to use this without proper benchmarking and monitoring of your environment.
