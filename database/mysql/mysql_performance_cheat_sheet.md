## System Variables

MySQL has lots of variables that you can consider to change. Some variables are dynamic which means they can be set using the SET statement. Others require a server restart, after they are set in the configuration file (e.g. /etc/my.cnf, etc/mysql/my.cnf). However, Iâ€™ll go over the common things that are pretty common to tune to make the server optimized.

### sort_buffer_size
This variable controls how large your filesort buffer is, which means that whenever a query needs to sort the rows, the value of this variable is used to limit the size that needs to be allocated. Take note that this variable is per-query that is processed (or per-connection) basis, which means that it would be a memory hungry when you set this higher and if you have multiple connections that requires sorting of your rows. However, you can monitor your needs by checking the global status variable Sort_merge_passes. If this value is large, you should consider increasing the value of the sort_buffer_size system variable. Otherwise, take it to the moderate limit that you need. If you set this too low or if you have large queries to process, the effect of sorting your rows can be slower than expected because data is retrieved randomly doing disk dives. This can cause performance degradation. However, it is best to fix your queries. Otherwise, if your application is designed to pull large queries and requires sorting, then it is efficient to use tools that handles query caching like Redis. By default, in MySQL 8.0, the current value set is 256 KiB. Set this accordingly only when you have queries that are heavily using or calling sorts.
